# Introduction
The package contains functions to calculate power and estimate sample size for various study designs used in (not only bio-) equivalence studies. Power and sample size can be obtained based on different methods, amongst them prominently the TOST procedure (two one-sided *t*-tests).\
Version `r packageVersion("PowerTOST")` built `r packageDate("PowerTOST")` with R `r getRversion()`.

For an overview of supported designs, methods, and defaults together with some basic examples see

  * [README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PowerTOST/readme/README.html) of the released version on CRAN;
  * [README](https://github.com/Detlew/PowerTOST/blob/master/README.md) of the development version on GitHub.
