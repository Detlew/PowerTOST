\title{
Scaled (widened) BE Acceptance Limits
}
\description{
The (widened) scaled BE acceptance limits are calculated according to the 
regulatory settings of EMA, HC, FDA or via user defined regulatory settings.
}
\usage{
scABEL(CV, regulator)
}
\arguments{
  \item{CV}{
Coefficient of variation (of the Reference) as ratio.
}
  \item{regulator}{
Regulatory body settings for the widening of the BE acceptance limits.\cr
May be given as character from the choices \code{"EMA"}, \code{"HC"}, \code{"FDA"} or as an object of
class 'regSet' (see \code{\link{reg_const}}).\cr
Defaults to \code{regulator="EMA"} if missing.\cr
The former \code{regulator="ANVISA"} is no longer allowed. The ANVISA 
recommends since 2016 the EMA\enc{â€™}{'}s regulatory settings.\cr
The former \code{regulator="USER"} is no longer accepted but can be handled now
via function \code{reg_const()} to define an object with class 'regSet'.
}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of lenghth 2 if one CV is given or a matrix if CV is given as vector 
with named components \code{lower} and \code{upper} of the scaled acceptance limits.
}
\details{
The widened BE acceptance limits are calculated by the formula\cr
\verb{  [L, U] = exp(-/+ r_const * sWR)}\cr
with \code{r_const} the regulatory constant and \code{sWR} the standard deviation of the within
subjects variability of the Reference.\cr
\itemize{
  \item \code{regulator="EMA"} or \code{regulator="HC"}\cr
  \code{r_const = 0.76} (~ log(1.25)/0.29356)
  \item \code{regulator="FDA"}\cr
  \code{r_const = 0.89257\dots} (= log(1.25)/0.25)
}
If the CVwR of the Reference is < CVswitch=0.3 the conventional ABE limits 
apply (mixed procedure).\cr\cr 
In case of \code{regulator="EMA"} a cap is placed on the widened limits if 
CVwR>0.5, \emph{i.e.}, the widened limits are held at the value calculated for CVwR=0.5.\cr
In case of \code{regulator="HC"} the capping is done such that the acceptance
limits are 0.6666 \dots 1.5 at maximum, \emph{i.e.}, CVcap=0.57382. 
Literally it is given by Health Canada rounded to three significant digits as 57.4\%.

\note{
The scaled acceptance limits are not directly used in the BE evaluation 
for highly variable drugs recommended by the FDA. They are included here
for comparative purposes. Moreover, there are controversies where to locate the 
so-called \sQuote{implied} BE acceptance limits. See reference below.
