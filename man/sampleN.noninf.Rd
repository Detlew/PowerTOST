\title{
Sample size for the non-inferiority t-test
}
\description{
Function for estimating the sample size needed to have a pre-specified power
for the one-sided non-inferiority \emph{t}-test for normal or log-normal distributed data.
}
\usage{
sampleN.noninf(alpha = 0.025, targetpower = 0.8, logscale = TRUE,
               margin,theta0, CV, design = "2x2", robust = FALSE, 
               details = FALSE, print = TRUE, imax=100)
}
\arguments{
  \item{alpha}{
Significance level (one-sided). Defaults here to 0.025.
}
  \item{targetpower}{
Power to achieve at least. Must be >0 and <1.\cr
Typical values are 0.8 or 0.9.
}
  \item{logscale}{
Should the data used on log-transformed or on original scale? \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}.
}
  \item{theta0}{
\sQuote{True} or assumed T/R ratio or difference.\cr
In case of \code{logscale=TRUE} it must be given as ratio T/R.\cr
If \code{logscale=FALSE}, the difference in means. In this case, the difference may be expressed in two ways: relative to the same (underlying) reference mean, i.e. as (T-R)/R = T/R - 1; or as difference in means T-R. Note that in the former case the units of \code{margin} and \code{CV} need also be given relative to the reference mean (specified as ratio).\cr
Defaults to 0.95 if \code{logscale=TRUE} or to -0.05 if \code{logscale=FALSE}
}
  \item{margin}{
Non-inferiority margin.\cr
In case of \code{logscale=TRUE} it is given as ratio.\cr
If \code{logscale=FALSE}, the limit may be expressed in two ways:
difference of means relative to the same (underlying) reference mean or in units of the difference of means.
Note that in the former case the units of \code{CV} and \code{theta0} need also be given relative to the reference mean (specified as ratio).\cr
Defaults to 0.8 if \code{logscale=TRUE} or to -0.2 if \code{logscale=FALSE}.
}
  \item{CV}{
In case of \code{logscale=TRUE} the (geometric) coefficient of variation given as ratio.\cr
If \code{logscale=FALSE} the argument refers to (residual) standard deviation of the response. In this case, standard deviation may be expressed two ways: relative to a reference mean (specified as ratio sigma/muR), i.e. again as a coefficient of variation; or untransformed, i.e. as standard deviation of the response. Note that in the former case the units of \code{theta0}, \code{theta1} and \code{theta2} need also be given relative to the reference mean (specified as ratio).\cr

In case of cross-over studies this is the within-subject CV, in case of a parallel-group design the CV of the total variability.
}
  \item{design}{
Character string describing the study design.\cr
See \code{\link{known.designs}} for designs covered in this package.
}
  \item{robust}{
Defaults to FALSE. With that value the usual degrees of freedom will be used.\cr
Set to \code{TRUE} will use the degrees of freedom according to the \sQuote{robust} evaluation
(aka Sennâ€™s basic estimator). These df are calculated as \code{n-seq}.\cr
See \code{known.designs()$df2} for designs covered in this package.\cr
Has only effect for higher-order crossover designs.
}
  \item{details}{
If \code{TRUE} the design characteristics and the steps during
sample size calculations will be shown.\cr 
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
}
  \item{print}{
If \code{TRUE} (default) the function prints its results.\cr 
If \code{FALSE} only the data.frame with the results will be returned. 
  }
  \item{imax}{
Maximum number of steps in sample size search. \cr 
Defaults to 100. Adaption only in rare cases needed.
  }
  
}
\details{
The sample size is calculated via iterative evaluation of \code{power.noninf()}.\cr
Start value for the sample size search is taken from a large sample approximation.\cr
The sample size is bound to 4 as minimum.\cr\cr
The estimated sample size gives always the \emph{total} number of subjects (not subject/sequence in crossovers or subjects/group in parallel designs -- like in some other software packages).\cr

\strong{Notes on the underlying hypotheses}\cr
If the supplied margin is < 0 (\code{logscale=FALSE}) or < 1 (\code{logscale=TRUE}), 
then it is assumed higher response values are better. The hypotheses are\cr
\verb{  H0: theta0 <= margin vs. H1: theta0 > margin},\cr
where \code{theta0 = mean(test)-mean(reference)} if \code{logscale=FALSE}\cr
or\cr
\verb{  H0: log(theta0) <= log(margin) vs. H1: log(theta0) > log(margin)},\cr
where \code{theta0 = mean(test)/mean(reference)} if \code{logscale=TRUE}.\cr

If the supplied margin is > 0 (\code{logscale=FALSE}) or > 1 (\code{logscale=TRUE}), 
then it is assumed lower response values are better. The hypotheses are\cr
\verb{  H0: theta0 >= margin vs. H1: theta0 < margin}\cr
where \code{theta0 = mean(test)-mean(reference)} if \code{logscale=FALSE}\cr
or\cr
\verb{  H0: log(theta0) >= log(margin) vs. H1: log(theta0) < log(margin)}\cr
where \code{theta0 = mean(test)/mean(reference)} if \code{logscale=TRUE}.\cr
This latter case may also be considered as \sQuote{non-superiority}.
}
\value{
A data.frame with the input settings and results will be returned.\cr
Explore it with \code{str(sampleN.noninf(...)}
}
\section{Warning }{
The function does not vectorize properly.\cr
If you need sample sizes with varying CVs, use f.i. for-loops or the apply-family.
